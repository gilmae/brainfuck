# Brainfuck
A compiler and virtual machine for running brainfuck code.

Initially a copy of Thorsten Ball's brainfuck machine, but re-written from zero as an exercise.

## TODO
* ~Folding optimisations~ are being done in the compiler
* Clear optimisation
* Copy optimisation
* Multiplication optimisation
